 Thanks for signing up for Backand! Once you've configured the Lambda Launcher's connection with your AWS account, you'll be able to easily execute your AWS Lambda functions from our Lambda Launcher tool. In the meantime, you can see a demo of the tool in action at   <a data-ng-href="https://launcher.backand.io/demo" title="Demo application" data-ng-click="$ctrl.modalInstance.dismiss('cancel')" target="_blank">https://launcher.backand.io/demo</a> - this gives you access to several test functions we've written to demonstrate the Lambda Launcher product.
