    <h2>Bringing your own database</h2>
    <p>
      Most back-end-as-a-service providers want you to work within their
      clearly-defined data roles. They often require you to port your data to
      their format, or provide only highly static interfaces to interact with
      and consume existing data. At Backand, we realize that the database is
      often the core of your business, and you need to be able to work with your
      data with minimal effort possible. That's why we have built a large suite
      of functionality around importing – and managing your existing SQL
      database. Backand can analyze your database structure and build a scaffold
      around your existing data quickly, allowing your application developers to
      very rapidly begin working with your existing database structure.
    </p>
    <h2>Importing your database </h2>
    <p>
      While you can create a new database from scratch using our JSON object modeling interface, the true power of Backand is shown when we integrate seamlessly with your existing database. When you connect your Backand application to an existing database on an external server, Backand quickly analyzes your database structure and constructs a meaningful interface on top of your data. This covers everything from basic table structure all the way up to complex foreign-key relationships and many-to-many mapping tables. Backand then uses this data to construct an API on top of your database, allowing you to interact with your data in a RESTful manner very quickly and easily.
    </p>
    <h2>Staying in sync</h2>
    <p>
While an import process is beneficial, it quickly loses its ease if it does not accurately track changes. Many vendors expect your database schema to remain static, and want to work only with your data – requiring a re-sync whenever the database structure changes. With Backand, the need to re-synchronize is completely removed from the process. Backand automatically detects changes to your underlying database and updates its representation of your data, removing a needless tertiary step in the process to ensure that your application remains synchronized with your database's structure. Furthermore, data changes are synced back to the database server nearly instantaneously, ensuring that no matter how you fetch your data it will always be up-to-date.
