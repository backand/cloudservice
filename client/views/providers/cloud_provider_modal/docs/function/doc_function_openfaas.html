  <p class="text">The OpenFaas is an event-driven, open source, Function-as-a-Service compute platform that can be run anywhere in the public, private, or hybrid clouds. OpenFaas provides simple-but-powerful extensibility.</p>
  <div class="form-group">
    <p class="text first">The OpenFaas is open-source software, allowing you to either maintain a local installation, or re-use an existing instance. To get started, head to the OpenFaas's <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas" target="_blank">Github page</a></p>
    
    <p class="text">To start working with OpenFaas, copy the server URL, and ensure the server is publicly accessible. If you are working with a server on localhost, you can use a tool like <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank">ngrok</a> to create a secure tunnel.</p>
