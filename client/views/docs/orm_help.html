      <h4><u>Clarifications</u></h4>
      <h5>
        - In addition to the fields supplied by the user, Backand defines an 'id' field, of type integer, which will be used as a primary key for the table.<br/>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        - Renaming fields can only be done from the Fields tab in the application dashboard. Renaming a field or an object in a model will delete the data associated with that field or object.
      </h5>
      <br/>
      <h4><u>Definitions</u></h4>
        <h5>
          The model represent a database schema that is defined as a JSON array of one or more object (Table) definitions:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;model&gt; = [  &lt;object&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, ... ]</code></pre>
        <h5>
          An object definition is a JSON object with a name entry and a fields entry:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;object&gt; = { "name":  &lt;string&gt;, "fields" : &lt;fields&gt; }</code></pre>
        <h5>
          The fields definition is a JSON list of field attributes:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;fields&gt; =  { "field1" : &lt;field&gt;, "field2": &lt;field&gt;, ... }</code></pre>
        <h5>
          A field is defined by its type and a set of optional properties. The field definition is a JSON object:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;field&gt; = { "type": &lt;type&gt;, &lt;optional properties&gt;}</code></pre>
        <h5>
          A field may have one of the following types:<br/>
          <ul>
            <li>string - string column up to 255 characters</li>
            <li>text - text column up to 21,844 characters</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>datetime</li>
            <li>boolean</li>
          </ul>
        </h5>
        <h5>
            We can optionally defined a field as required (`NOT NULL`) or not:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"required": &lt;boolean value&gt;</code></pre>
        <h5>
            Where a boolean value is true or false.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            And set its default value:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"defaultValue": &lt;value&gt;</code></pre>
        <h5>
          Where `&lt;value&gt;` is of the type of the field.
        </h5>
        <br/>
        <h4><u>One-to-Many Relationship</u></h4>
        <h5>
          One-to-many relationship between objects are specified using relationship fields. A relationship field will generate the appropriate foreign-key relationship fields in the corresponding relation objects - <a href="http://docs.backand.com/en/latest/getting_started/objects/index.html#one-to-many-relationship" target="_blank">read more</a>.<br/><br/>
        </h5>
        <h5>
            In the example shown above, consider a model describing users' todo list. It has two objects, users and
            tasks. Each user can have several tasks (todo), but a task has a single user associated with (created_by). Thus, the users-tasks relationship is a one to many relationship between users and tasks:
          <br/><br/>
          The 'users' object will have a 'todo' relationship field, which establishes the 'one' side of the relationship by creating a collection of tasks objects for each user:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"todo": {"collection": "tasks","via": "created_by"}</code></pre>
        <h5>
          The 'tasks' object will have 'created_by' a relationship field, which establishes the 'many' side of the relationship by linking each task back to an individual user instance of type 'users':
        </h5>
<pre><code>"created_by": {"object": "users"}</code></pre>
        <br/>
        <h4><u>Many-to-Many Relationship</u></h4>
        <h5>
            Many-to-Many relationships between objects are added by adding a new object that has a one-to-many relationship with each object participating in the many-to-many relation - <a href="http://docs.backand.com/en/latest/getting_started/objects/index.html#many-to-many-relationship" target="_blank">read more</a>.<br/>
        </h5>
        <h5>
            As an example, consider a different model describing tasks collaboration. It has two objects, users and
            tasks. Each user can own several tasks, and each task can have several users associated with. Thus, the users-tasks relationship is many to many relationship between users and tasks.<br/>
        </h5>
        <h5>
            To implement the many-to-many relationship we just need to add a new object - "users-tasks" - with
            one-to-many relationships to both users and tasks objects.<br/>
        </h5>
