      <h4><u>Clarifications</u></h4>
      <h5>
        - In addition to the fields supplied by the user, Backand defines one more field as primary key:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>"id" - integer - primary key</li>
        </ul>
      </h5>
      <h5>
        - Rename to fields can be done only from th Fields tab. Renaming the field or the object in the model will delete the data associated with that field or object.
      </h5>
      <h4><u>Definitions</u></h4>
        <h5>
        The model represent a database schema that is defined as a JSON array of one or more objects (Table) definitions:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;model&gt; = [  &lt;object&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, ... ]</code></pre>
        <h5>
        An object definition is a JSON object with a name and a fields definition:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;object&gt; = { "name":  &lt;string&gt;, "fields" : &lt;fields&gt; }</code></pre>
        <h5>
            The fields definition is a JSON object, with an attribute for each field:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;fields&gt; =  { "field1" : &lt;field&gt;, "field2": &lt;field&gt;, ... }</code></pre>
        <h5>
              A field is defined by its type and a set of optional properties. The field definition is a JSON object:
        </h5>
<pre><code>&lt;field&gt; = { "type": &lt;type&gt;, &lt;optional properties&gt;}</code></pre>
        <h5>
            The type of a field is one of the following:<br/>
          <ul>
            <li>string - string column up to 255 characters</li>
            <li>text - text column up to 21,844 characters</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>datetime</li>
            <li>boolean</li>
          </ul>
        </h5>
        <!--<h5>
            We can optionally defined a field as required (`NOT NULL`) or not:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"required": &lt;boolean value&gt;</pre></code>
        <h5>
            Where a boolean value is true or false.
        </h5>-->
        <!--<h5>
            And set its default value:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"defaultValue": &lt;value&gt;</pre></code>
        <h5>
          Where `&lt;value&gt;` is of the type of the field.
        </h5>-->

        <h4><u>One-to-Many Relationship</u></h4>
        <h5>
          One-to-many relationship between tables are specified by means of relationship fields. A relationship field will generate appropriate foreign relationship fields in the corresponding relations.<br/><br/>
          Say we have a one to many relationship between tables R and S. Here for each row in R there are many corresponding rows in S.<br/><br/>
          In the many side of the relationship (object S), we specify that each row relates to one row in the other object R.
        </h5>
<pre><code>"myR" : { "object" : "R" }</pre></code>
        <h5>
          In the one side of the relationship (object R), we specify that each row relates to several rows in S:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"Rs" : { "collection": "S", "via" : "myR" }</pre></code>
        <h5>
          In the database, we will have a foreign relationship constraint from S to R, represented by a foreign key field `myR` in the object S. This field will hold the key of the corresponding row in R for each row in S.<br/>
          As an example, consider a database describing pet ownership. It has two tables, `user` and `pet`.<br/>
          <br/>
          Each user can own several pets, but a pet has a single owner. Thus the person-pet relationship is a one to many relationship between person and pet:<br/>
          <br/>
          The `user` object will have a `pets` a relationship field:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"pets": { "collection": "pet", "via": "owner" }</pre></code>
        <h5>
          The `pet` table will have an owner `owner` a relationship field:
        </h5>
<pre><code>"owner": { "object": "person" }</pre></code>
        <br/>
